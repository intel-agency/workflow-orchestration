description: Continue a previously interrupted orchestrate-dynamic-workflow for project-setup

You had previously been performing the `orchestrate-dynamic-workflow` assignment with $workflow_name = `project-setup`, but were interrupted.

When you begin it again, some items may already be finished.

After analyzing your workflow assignment steps, perform a status check to see what's already completed and what still needs to be performed.

/orchestrate-dynamic-workflow
  - $workflow_name = `project-setup`
